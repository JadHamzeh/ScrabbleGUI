# Scrabble 

This project is a simplified implementation of the Scrabble game using **Java**. It supports multiplayer gameplay with word validation and scoring mechanisms based on Scrabble rules.

## **How to Play**

1. **Start the Game**  
   Launch the game, and players will take turns entering words to play on the board.

2. **Word Validation**  
   - Words are checked against a predefined list stored in `WordBank.txt`.
   - If the word is invalid, the player must try again.

3. **Placing Words**  
   - Players select a letter from their hand.
   - Players select the **direction** of the word: Horizontal or Vertical.
   - Players place tile selected on board

4. **End of Turn**  
   - If the move is valid, the board updates with the new word, and the next player’s turn begins.
   - If the move is invalid, the player retries the turn.
   - If player wants they  can skip

5. **Winning the Game**  
   - The game continues until all tiles are used or no valid moves remain.
   - The player with the **highest score** at the end wins.

## AI Strategy
The Scrabble game features an AI player that follows a strategic decision-making process. Here’s how the AI works:

### AI Logic
1. **Word Generation**
- The AI scans the board for existing tiles.
- It combines the board's letters with its own hand tiles to generate potential words of lengths 2-5.

2. **Word Validation**
-Each generated word is validated against the word dictionary (WordBank.txt) to ensure it’s legal.
-The AI considers both horizontal and vertical placements.

3. **Score Calculation**
-The AI calculates scores for all valid words, considering Scrabble's point rules and bonus tiles (e.g., double word and triple letter).

4. **Optimal Move Selection**
-The AI selects the highest-scoring valid word.
-It prioritizes moves that leverage bonus tiles or create high-value combinations.

5. **Execution**
-The AI places its chosen word on the board and updates its hand.
-If no valid moves are available, the AI skips its turn.

## **Features**

- **Multiplayer Support**  
  - Allows up to **4 players**, each starting with 7 tiles.

- **Word Validation**  
  - Words are validated against a dictionary file (`WordBank.txt`).

- **Score Calculation**  
  - Tiles have point values according to **Scrabble rules**.
  - Bonus points are awarded for placing all 7 tiles in one turn (Bingo).

- **Board Management**  
  - A **15x15 board** is displayed and updated with each move.

- **Tile Management**  
  - Tiles are drawn from a shared tile pile.
  - Players manage their hand by adding and removing tiles.

## **Premium Tiles**

Premium Tiles are represented in the GUI as 4 colors.  
**Red** Tiles represent a Triple Word bonus  
**Pink** Tiles represent a Double Word bonus  
**Blue** Tiles represent a Triple Letter bonus  
**Cyan** Tiles represent a Double Letter bonus

## **Technologies Used**

- **Java**  
  - Core programming language for the project.

- **Collections Framework**  
  - `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, and `Arrays` for tile and word management.
